\subsection{How is Turbulence Maintained?}\label{sec:turb-maint}
Turbulence may be maintained by external drivers, such as galactic shear \cite{Dobbs_2013} or by feedback from forming stars. \citet{Nakamura_2007} investigate the effect of molecular outflows from protostars on turbulence in a 1.5 pc clump. They show that the outflows inject enough momentum into the clump to maintain turbulence and support the clump against global collapse. \citet{Moraghan_2013} measure the density distribution in a simulated clouds where outflows maintain turbulence. With such feedback, the density distribution increases above log-normal at low densities, representing the cavities excavated around protostars.
