\subsubsection{North American Nebula}\label{sec:nan}
The North American Nebula (NAN) is a region with both high and low-mass star formation located at a distance of $\sim$550 pc \cite{Laugalys06}. CO observations by \citet{Zhang14} indicate that 50,000 M$_\odot$ of molecular gas in front of the W80 HII region. The "North America" shape comes from this background HII region. This HII region is expanding into the molecular cloud, powering an expanding CO bubble \cite{Bally80}. Using deep NIR imaging, \citet{Bally14} report cometary structures and many outflows identified by shock-excited H$_2$ emission. There has been no systematic survey of the impact of feedback on the NAN molecular cloud, and this will from the basis of my third paper (\S\ref{sec:paper3}). A comparison of the feedback budget in Orion A and NAN will be the focus of paper four (\S\ref{sec:paper4}).
