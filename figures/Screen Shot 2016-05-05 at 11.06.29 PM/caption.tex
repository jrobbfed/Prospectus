\label{fig:channelmaps} $^{12}CO$ maps of shell candidate at nine different velocity channels. The circular morphology is clearest at 11 km/s. The shell candidate at 16-17 km/s is the only emission at these high velocities in the entire cloud, except for the explosive outflow from Orion KL to the upper right.
