\section{Background}\label{sec:bkgrd}

\subsection{Star Formation}\label{sec:sf}
Stars form when clouds of molecular gas exceed the critical density where gravitational contraction overcomes the random gas motions. Below I sketch a general outline of the current understanding of the process by which gas becomes stars, as reviewed by \cite{McKee_2007}, \cite{Draine11}, and \cite{Dunham_2014}. 

Molecular gas in the Milky Way is hierarchical. The largest structures, \textit{giant molecular clouds} (GMCs), condense out of diffuse neutral hydrogen through gravitational instabilities caused by colliding flows or spiral arm overdensities. GMCs are made of molecular \textit{clumps}, the self-gravitating structures of gas that form star clusters. The areas of peak density in clumps are termed molecular \textit{cores}. A core collapses when its internal gas pressure is overpowered by gravity, forming a protostar.

The evolution of protostars is roughly tracked by their infrared spectral energy distribution. As the protostar accretes mass and clears the cold material around it, the SED shifts to hotter bolometric temperatures. This change in the SED is denoted by Classes 0-III, as reviewed by \cite{Andre00}

Protostars add mass from an accretion disk which in turn is fed by infall from a surrounding envelope of dense gas (Class 0). As a protostar evolves this disk grows and the envelope diminishes (Class I). The accretion disk powers a strong wind which triggers bipolar outflows (see \S\ref{sec:outflow}) of molecular gas around the protostar. The accretion and outflow help to clear the envelope, and the protostar becomes a pre-main sequence star (Class II-III). Pre-main sequence and main sequence stars can affect their host cloud through spherical stellar winds (\S\ref{sec:wind}) and UV ionization and heating (\S\ref{sec:uv}).

\subsection{The Low Star Formation Efficiency}\label{sec:sfe}
Only a small fraction of a molecular cloud is converted into stars. On average, the star formation efficiency of galactic molecular clouds is $\sim 5\%$ \cite{McKee_2007}. But if gravity and thermal pressure where the only forces at work, clouds should collapse into stars in a dynamical time. Why are molecular clouds so inefficient at forming stars? Potential causes of this inefficiency are magnetic fields, short cloud lifetimes, and turbulence. 

Magnetic fields can support cores against collapse. The ions in such cores are locked to the magnetic fields, while neutral particles and dust gradually diffuse inward (\citet{Mestel_1956};~\citet{Shu_1983}). This process, called \textit{ambipolar diffusion}, slows the collapse of the core and reduces its star formation efficiency. The observed magnetic fields in many clouds are not strong enough to be the only support against gravitational collapse \cite{Crutcher_2012}.

If molecular clouds only exist for brief amounts of time, they may only have a chance to form a few stars before they are completely disrupted by external (e.g. shear from the galaxy's potential) or internal (e.g. supernovae) forces. \citet{Murray_2011} argues that molecular clouds only live for two to three free-fall times, and \citet{Dobbs_2013} use hydrodynamic simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy to support the claim that molecular clouds are transient. If clouds are not long lived, this removes the necessity for them to be supported against gravitational collapse for long periods of time. 

Molecular clouds exhibit characteristics of supersonic turbulence. \citet{Larson81} showed that the line-width of clouds, clumps, and cores show a power-law dependence on their physical size. The larger the structure, the higher the velocity dispersion within it. This relationship is characteristic of a turbulent medium. Because of this size dependent velocity dispersion, turbulent pressure prevents large scale collapse of a cloud, while allowing local collapse of cores into protostars \cite{Mac_Low_2004}.

\subsection{Turbulence Regulated Star Formation}\label{sec:turb}

However, turbulence dissipates quickly (on the order of a crossing time). So how is it maintained?


\subsection{How is Turbulence Maintained?}\label{sec:turb-maint}
Turbulence may be maintained by external drivers, such as galactic shear \cite{Dobbs_2013} or by feedback from forming stars. \citet{Nakamura_2007} investigate the effect of molecular outflows from protostars on turbulence in a 1.5 pc clump. They show that the outflows inject enough momentum into the clump to maintain turbulence and support the clump against global collapse. \citet{Moraghan_2013} measure the density distribution in a simulated clouds where outflows maintain turbulence. With such feedback, the density distribution increases above log-normal at low densities, representing the cavities excavated around protostars.

\subsection{Stellar Feedback}\label{sec:feedback}
Stellar feedback can potentially maintain turbulence and reduce the star formation efficiency in molecular clouds. While I will focus on these effects, feedback may also trigger star formation and influence the mass assembly of protostars. This motivates my thesis question: \textit{How does feedback from stars of various masses and evolutionary states affect the structure and evolution of molecular clouds?} In the next sections I introduce the different types of feedback important in molecular clouds.

\subsubsection{Bipolar Outflows}\label{sec:outflow}
Bipolar outflows are ubiquitous around low-mass protostars. Outflows are generated by a strong accretion-driven wind which is collimated into a jet by magnetic fields. This jet shocks the surrounding molecular gas, entraining material in bipolar outflows. Bipolar outflows have been studied extensively in CO emission (e.g. \citet{Plunkett_2013}~;\cite{Plunkett_2015}), and their shocks can be identified in optical wavelengths \cite{Reipurth_2001}. The amount of momentum in bipolar outflows may be able to support turbulence on clump scales (\citet{Frank14}~;\citet{Offner_2014}).
