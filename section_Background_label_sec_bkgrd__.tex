\section{Background}\label{sec:bkgrd}

\subsection{Star Formation}\label{sec:sf}
Stars form when clouds of molecular gas exceed the critical density where gravitational contraction overcomes the random gas motions. Below I sketch a general outline of the current understanding of the process by which gas becomes stars, as reviewed by \cite{McKee_2007}, \cite{Draine11}, and \cite{Dunham_2014}. 

Molecular gas in the Milky Way is hierarchical. The largest structures, \textit{giant molecular clouds} (GMCs), condense out of diffuse neutral hydrogen through gravitational instabilities caused by colliding flows or spiral arm overdensities. GMCs are made of molecular \textit{clumps}, the self-gravitating structures of gas that form star clusters. The areas of peak density in clumps are termed molecular \textit{cores}. A core collapses when its internal gas pressure is overpowered by gravity, forming a protostar.

\subsection{The Low Star Formation Efficiency}\label{sec:sfe}
Only a small fraction of a molecular cloud is converted into stars. On average, the star formation efficiency of galactic molecular clouds is $\sim 5\%$. But if gravity and thermal pressure where the only forces at work, clouds should collapse into stars in a dynamical time. Why are molecular clouds so inefficient at forming stars? Magnetic fields can support cores against collapse. The ions in such cores are locked to the magnetic fields, while neutral particles and dust gradually diffuse inward. This process, called \textit{ambipolar diffusion}, can slow star formation.
