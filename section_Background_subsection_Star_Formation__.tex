\section{Background}

\subsection{Star Formation}
Stars form when clouds of molecular gas exceed the critical density where gravitational contraction overcomes the random gas motions. Below I sketch a general outline of the current understanding of this process by which gas becomes stars, as reviewed by 

Molecular gas in the Milky Way is hierarchical. The largest structures are giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
