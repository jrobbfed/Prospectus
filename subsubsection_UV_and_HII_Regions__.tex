\subsubsection{UV and HII Regions}\label{sec:uv}
Massive stars emit strongly in the FUV, which heats and ionizes surrounding gas. In a molecular cloud, such heating can sculpt features like cometary clouds and pillars (\citet{1983A&A...117..183R};~\citet{Walawender04}). Intermediate mass stars between 3-8 M$_\odot$ do not emit strongly ionizing radiation fields, but the most massive stars produce HII regions which expand and can disrupt much of a cloud. The prototypical, and closest, HII region is M42. Powered by the Trapezium cluster of OB stars, this HII region has carved out an opening in its progenitor molecular cloud, allowing a rare glimpse of forming stars in optical wavelengths (\citet{Odell93};~\citet{Ricci_2008}). Aside from ionizing and disrupting molecular clouds, HII regions may also trigger star formation as they sweep through a cloud \cite{Deharveng_2010}. An expanding HII region collects gas in a layer between the shock front and ionization front, which can exceed the threshold needed for fragmentation. Alternatively, as the ionization front passes over a molecular core the increased pressure of the ionized surrounding can compress the core and trigger collapse.

All of the preceding feedback mechanisms affect the structure and evolution of molecular clouds. I will now provide an introduction to the molecular clouds which will be the focus of my thesis.
