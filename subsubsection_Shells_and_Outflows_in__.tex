\subsubsection{Shells and Outflows in North American Nebula (Year 2)}\label{sec:paper3}
        The North American Nebula (NAN) has been observed with the Purple Mountain Obseratory 12.7m telescope by \citet{Zhang14}. I will combine the CARMA data with these maps to arrive at a similar spatial dynamic range as achieved in Orion A. After imaging, I will lead the search for bipolar outflows and shells in the cloud. I will use point source catalogs from \citet{Rebull_2011} and \citet{Zhang14} to search for driving sources for these feedback features. I will then calculate the feedback physics in the same way as in Orion A. This will be the first systematic search for CO feedback features in NAN.
