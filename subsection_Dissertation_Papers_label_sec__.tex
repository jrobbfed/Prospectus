        \subsubsection{Wind-Blown Shells in Orion A}\label{sec:paper1}
Orion A has been mapped in CO by many previous studies$CITE ALL THE CO SURVEY PAPERS HERE$. The CARMA Orion maps represent the best combination of angular resolution (6"), spectral resolution (0.14 km/s), and coverage (0.01 pc to 10 pc) of any CO survey of Orion A to date. This will allow us to characterize feedback in the cloud more completely than ever before. Moreover, this is the first systematic search for shells from low to intermediate-mass stellar winds in Orion.
        
I have not completed the combination of NRO and CARMA data (see~\S\ref{sec:status}).  Using only the single-dish maps, I present an overview of Orion A and an example of a candidate shell below.
