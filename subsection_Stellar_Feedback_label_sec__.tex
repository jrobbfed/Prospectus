\subsection{Stellar Feedback}\label{sec:feedback}
Stellar feedback can potentially maintain turbulence and reduce the star formation efficiency in molecular clouds. While I will focus on these effects, feedback may also trigger star formation and influence the mass assembly of protostars. This motivates my thesis question: \textit{How does feedback from stars of various masses and evolutionary states affect the structure and evolution of molecular clouds?} In the next sections I introduce the different types of feedback important in molecular clouds.
