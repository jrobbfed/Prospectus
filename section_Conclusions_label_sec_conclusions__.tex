\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
My thesis addresses two major questions in the study of star formation in molecular clouds. First, how prevalent are shells in clouds, what generates them, and at what scale can they support a cloud against collapse? This question will be addressed by Papers I and III. Second, what type of feedback is most dominant in different cloud environments and spatial scales? This will be the subject of Papers II, III, and IV. The CARMA Orion survey, by combining interferometry and single-dish observations, provides the dynamic range, coverage, and molecular tracers needed to answer these questions.
