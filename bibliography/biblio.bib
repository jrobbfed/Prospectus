@article{Andre00,
  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed significant advances in our observational understanding of the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. The advent of sensitive receivers on large radio telescopes such as the JCMT and IRAM 30m MRT has led to the identification of young protostars at the beginning of the main accretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the first time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects are characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at submillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and powerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been observed toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars which have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass. In contrast to protostars, pre-stellar cores have flat inner density profiles, suggesting the initial conditions for fast protostellar collapse depart sometimes significantly from a singular isothermal sphere. In the case of non-singular initial conditions, the beginning of protostellar evolution is expected to feature a brief phase of vigorous accretion/ejection which may coincide with Class 0 objects. In addition, submillimeter continuum imaging surveys of regions of multiple star formation such as Ophiuchus and Serpens suggest a picture according to which each star in an embedded cluster is built from a finite reservoir of mass and the associated IMF is primarily determined at the pre-stellar stage of evolution.},

@article{Larson81,
  abstract = {Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},
