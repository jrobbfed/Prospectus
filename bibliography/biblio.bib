@article{Andre00,
  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed significant advances in our observational understanding of the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. The advent of sensitive receivers on large radio telescopes such as the JCMT and IRAM 30m MRT has led to the identification of young protostars at the beginning of the main accretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the first time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects are characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at submillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and powerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been observed toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars which have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass. In contrast to protostars, pre-stellar cores have flat inner density profiles, suggesting the initial conditions for fast protostellar collapse depart sometimes significantly from a singular isothermal sphere. In the case of non-singular initial conditions, the beginning of protostellar evolution is expected to feature a brief phase of vigorous accretion/ejection which may coincide with Class 0 objects. In addition, submillimeter continuum imaging surveys of regions of multiple star formation such as Ophiuchus and Serpens suggest a picture according to which each star in an embedded cluster is built from a finite reservoir of mass and the associated IMF is primarily determined at the pre-stellar stage of evolution.},

  abstract = {Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

@article{Frank14,
  abstract = {In this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star- and planet-formation process. Our essential question can be posed as follows:  Are jets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation, or do they play an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars both individually and globally? We address this question by reviewing the current state of observations and their key points of contact with theory. Our review of jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains:  (1) source and disk scales (0.1-102 AU) where the connection with protostellar and disk evolution theories is paramount; (2) envelope scales (102-105 AU) where the chemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its variability and its impact on the infalling envelope; and (3) parent cloud scales (105-106 AU) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloud environments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance on the smallest scales, where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted by the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks, or shielding by the winds. Feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass (core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback also plays an important role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent support within clusters, including alteration of cluster star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). In describing these observations we also look to the future and consider the questions that new facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Array can address. A particularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jet dynamics from the emerging field of high-energy-density laboratory astrophysics (HEDLA), which is now providing direct insights into the three-dimesional dynamics of fully magnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.},
